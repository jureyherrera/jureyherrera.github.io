abstract: TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) have a wide range of industrial applications (paintings, sunscreens, food and cosmetics) and is one of the most intensively used nanomaterials worldwide. Leaching from commercial products TiO2-NPs are predicted to significantly accumulate in wastewater sludges, which are then often used as soil amendment. In this work, sludge samples from four wastewater treatment plants of the Chihuahua State in Mexico were obtained during spring and summer (2017). A comprehensive characterization study was performed by X-ray based (laboratory and synchrotron) techniques and electron microscopy. Ti was detected in all sludge samples (1810–2760 mg/kg) mainly as TiO2 particles ranging from 40 nm up to hundreds of nm. Micro-XANES data was analyzed by principal component analysis and linear combination fitting enabling the identification of three predominant Ti species.- anatase, rutile and ilmenite. Micro-XANES from the smaller Ti particles was predominantly anatase (68% + 32% rutile), suggesting these TiO2-NPs originate from paintings and cosmetics. TEM imaging confirmed the presence of nanoscale Ti with smooth surface morphologies resembling engineered TiO2-NPs. The size and crystalline phase of TiO2-NPs in the sludge from this region suggest increased reactivity and potential toxicity to agro-systems. Further studies should be dedicated to evaluating this.
