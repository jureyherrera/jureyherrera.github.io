title: Modelling techniques for insertion device power management, photon transport and coherence propagation for ESRF beamlines
event: XOPT2023
event_url: https://xopt.opicon.jp/xopt2023/
location: Yokohama, Japan
summary: This work presents new simulation tools developed to address the challenges in designing beamlines for next-generation, fourth-generation synchrotron sources like the ESRF's Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS).
abstract: "Some synchrotron facilities worldwide (many are in transition to) have a 4th
generation storage ring, which is the case of the Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS) at the
European Synchrotron (ESRF).  Its lower emittance has substantially improved
brilliance and coherence of its X-ray sources. In addition, many ESRF beamlines are
implementing long undulators (> 2 m) with short magnetic periods (< 20 mm) of in-
vacuum cryogenic permanent magnets (CPUM), which are foreseen to operate with
small gaps (~5 mm). The combination of the above can result in quite high incoming
power over some beamline components, therefore it is important to assess the impact of
such heat-loads on the photon beam properties, e.g., size, flux and coherence. In this work,
we present some recent developed simulation tools and typical workflows to face the
different challenges present in the modelling and design of the EBS beamlines. Manly
carried out by the modelling team of the mechanical engineering group from the
instrumentation services and development division at the ESRF"
